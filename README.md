# ClassicBestiary

Displays creature ability information in the game tooltip when available. Hold Control while hovering over a unit to display descriptions for spells.

This fork came about because I though the original had too many issues. And since the db.lua generation is closed source I had to create one myself. Mine uses a variety of different data sources.
